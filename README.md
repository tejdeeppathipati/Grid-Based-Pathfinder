# Grid-Based Pathfinding Game

## Description
This project is a grid-based pathfinding game implemented in Java. The game allows users to explore various pathfinding algorithms and optimize routes across a 9x9 grid. The game incorporates object-oriented principles, recursion, and custom data structures to solve complex route optimization problems. Users can dynamically load fields, place obstacles, and visualize the optimal pathfinding process.

## Features
- 9x9 grid-based pathfinding with obstacles and dynamic visualization.
- Multiple iteration modes (entire grid, obstacles only, passages only).
- Recursive algorithms for optimal pathfinding and diagonal/forward movement.
- GUI developed using Java Swing for an interactive experience.
- Efficient traversal and custom iterators for game elements.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing
- **Algorithms:** Recursive algorithms for pathfinding optimization
- **Data Structures:** Custom data structures for route optimization and grid traversal
